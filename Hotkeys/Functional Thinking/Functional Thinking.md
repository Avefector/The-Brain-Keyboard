A framework for the interfacing structure of the fixed sequence of something that functions, both in concept and in practice.

- **Layer 1** - Name and Define **Functions**
1. A uni-gram is for capturing a concept by a single frame. ^6br3d
	- [[#^a5hxg|^a5hxg]]
	- [[Hotkeys#^022xq]]
2. [[N-grams]] are for capturing variations of a concept in a specific, coherent order of steps (sequence). ^a5hxg
    - [[#^cqe6x|^cqe6x]]
	- [[Hotkeys#^an8nq]]
	- [[Hotkeys#^w1u5i]]
- **Layer 2** - Replacing and Linking **Functions** in any Problem 
3. Within uni-gram and/or n-grams, capture any descriptors within then [Search up](http://www.sinonimkata.com/) **Synonyms** to relate, **Antonyms** to change, **Hyponyms** to specify and **Hypernyms** to simplify to capture any [[N-grams]]. ^cqe6x
    - [[#^6br3d|^6br3d]]
    - [[Hotkeys#^oyt0v]]
