My approach to learning the world around us.

## Every Core/Community Plugin I used:

- ## Search
- line:(), section:() and file:
	- Functions for the native Search tab which yield more results in return.
- Simple CanvaSearch: Open CanvaSearch modal
	- Searches and redirect you to any card within a .canvas file.
- Bartender plugin - click on the folder tab, then click the magnifying glass at the top.
	- Search any file within the folder tab.
- Another Quick Switcher: Landmark search
	- Switch between one note to another by its Links.
- Another Quick Switcher: Reveal a folder in the file tree
	- Switch between one note to another by folder notes.
- Omnisearch: Vault Search + In-file Search
	- Allows for precise searching within any sort of file (including images) as well as all throughout the vault.
- ## Bullet Points
- Make Bullet Point or Checkbox (Cycle Bullet/Checkbox) + Indent or Outdent Bullet Point
	- For adding insights & details and then allows me to hide and show links to be more specific towards any other information it can extrapolate either within or towards other notes. 
- Move a bullet point's position
- Note Refactor: Extract selection to new note - first line as file name
	- Transforms Bullet Point into its own Note then replaces itself with a link in the previous note to go in-depth with this piece of insight.
- Folder notes: Create folder note from selected text
	- Transforms Bullet Point into its own Folder Note then replaces itself with a link in the previous (Folder) note to go in-depth with this piece of insight.
- Toggle Bullet list
	- Merges your insights together by removing or adding Bullet Points in case you have too many sub-bullet points.
- PDF++: Create dummy file
	- Creates a file for your PDF stored locally or from a Web Link at a small size to save space in your vault.
- Timestamp Notes: Open Sample Model (complex)
	- Opens any video or audio file in its own tab outside of your vault.
- Timestamp Notes: open video player copy video url and use hotkey
	- Opens a video of any web URL in its own tab which is copy-pasted within any created/pre-existing .md file.
- Timestamp Notes: Insert timestamp based on videos current play time
	- Timestamp any moment of a video then click to replay like with any bullet point.
- ## Links
- Carry-Forward: Copy link to line (Default Link Text)
	- Create and carry a Block ID's link from one bullet point to another anywhere within or outside notes.
	- Click spacebar between the information or media and your block IDs then copy-paste and/or drag it towards the end.
		- Hold down the left or right arrow button on your keyboard to see where the ID is.
- Carry-Forward: Copy Selection with each line linked to its copied source (Default Link Text)
	- Same function as "Copy link to line" and copy-pastes the insights straight onto your idea for a project.
- Links: Delete Link
- []\(<>) Syntax - Image-to-Link Media Linking
	- Turns your image into a link towards another note.
	- You must be sure to copy-and-paste the Block ID link and remove the square brackets to allow for more bullet points to work in editing mode.
	- Not just limited to just pictures. Videos, Music, etc. work too!
- Note Auto-Creator - Type "=" + "]" (then optionally add a /)
	- Adds a link to an existing and/or auto-creates new note in a link with the "/" symbol at the end.
- Strange New Worlds: Toggle active state of SNW plugin on/off
	- Quick linking in any note through tagged numbers next to insights.
- Map of Content plugin tab
	- Hierarchically ties every note's connection to one another in a decentralized manner.
- Better File Link: Add File Link
	- Allows you to add a link to a file stored locally to save space in your vault.
- ## Canvas
- Add new cards by double-clicking, right-click to select "Add Card" or Click the "Drag to Add Card" button down below.
	- The aforementioned card can be double-clicked by the middle of the arrow and labelled however you please. It can hook unto other cards by clicking-and-dragging their sides to form arrows; be they edited Nondirectional, Unidirectional or Bidirectional.
	- Right-click and click "Convert to file".
		- Converts cards into future .md files to draft out incoming insights.
- Link Exploder: Create Canvas From File Links
	- Turns one note of insights into a Canvas file by mapping out its insights and placing links from every other note its insights are connected to (including media files).
- ## Folder Notes
- Move current file to another folder
	- Move note(s) into any existing folder and/or places note(s) into its own folder note regardless of file type(s).
- By right-clicking one file, many at a time with alt + left-clicking or one end to another in a row with alt + left-clicking THEN shift + left-clicking.
- File Chucker: Move to new or existing folder
	- Move one note (if it links to two or more notes) into any existing folder note.

	- Add as many files as possible onto a canvas from the search results in the search tab.
	- Also helps in recursively linking canvases together (much like how the Carry-Forward plugin works).

Enjoy. I wish you the very best of luck!
